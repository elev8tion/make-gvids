## What Is Kling API Concurrency?

Kling API concurrency refers to the maximum number of generation tasks an account can process simultaneously. The upper limit is related to the account, model version, and resource package. A higher concurrency level allows you to submit more API generation requests simultaneously (each call to the task creation interface creates a new generation task).

> **Notes:**
> - This limit only applies to the task creation interface; query interfaces do not consume concurrency.
> - This limitation concerns the number of concurrent tasks and is unrelated to Queries Per Second (QPS). The system does not impose any QPS limits.

## Core Rules

| Category | Rule Description |
|---|---|
| Application Scope | Independently calculated by account, model version, and resource package type (video/image/virtual try on) on a per account basis, with shared quotas for all API keys |
| Occupancy Logic | A task occupies concurrency from entering the Submitted status until completion (including failures). Concurrency is released immediately after the task ends. |
| Quota Calculation | The concurrency quota is determined by the highest concurrency value among all active resource packages of the same type. Example: If both a 5-concurrency and a 10-concurrency video package are active, the video concurrency capacity is 10. |

### Special Notes

- Video / Virtual Try-on tasks: Each task consumes 1 concurrency slot.
- Image generation tasks: The concurrency used equals the `n` value in the API request. (Example: n = 9 → consumes 9 concurrency)

## Over-Limit Error Mechanism

When the number of running tasks reaches the concurrency limit, submitting a request will return an error:

```json
{
    "code": 1303,
    "message": "parallel task over resource pack limit",
    "request_id": "9984d27b-a408-4073-ae28-17ca6a13622d"
}
```

## Recommended Approach

Since this error is triggered by system load (not by parameter issues), it is recommended to:

- **Backoff Retry Strategy:** Use an exponential backoff algorithm to delay retries (recommended initial delay ≥ 1 second).
- **Queue Management:** Control the submission rate through a task queue and dynamically adapt to available concurrency.
