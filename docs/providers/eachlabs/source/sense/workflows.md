## Overview

each::sense can create and execute [each::workflows](/workflows/overview) entirely through natural language. No API calls to the workflows engine required!

## Creating Workflows

Describe what you want and the agent builds the workflow:

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Create a workflow that: 1) Generates a portrait, 2) Animates it into a video, 3) Adds lip sync with audio"
    }],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

The agent emits workflow events as it builds:

```
data: {"type":"status","message":"Creating workflow..."}
data: {"type":"workflow_created","workflow_id":"wf_abc123","version_id":"v1","steps_count":3}
data: {"type":"text_response","content":"I've created your workflow!"}
data: {"type":"complete","status":"ok"}
data: [DONE]
```

## Executing Workflows

### By Name

```json
{
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Run my portrait-to-video workflow with description='Professional woman, 30s'"
  }]
}
```

### By ID

```json
{
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Execute this workflow with description: Professional headshot"
  }],
  "workflow_id": "wf_abc123",
  "version_id": "v1"
}
```

### Execution Progress Events

```
data: {"type":"execution_started","execution_id":"exec_xyz"}
data: {"type":"execution_progress","step_id":"step1","step_status":"completed","completed_steps":1,"total_steps":3}
data: {"type":"execution_progress","step_id":"step2","step_status":"running","completed_steps":1,"total_steps":3}
data: {"type":"execution_progress","step_id":"step2","step_status":"completed","output":"https://...","completed_steps":2,"total_steps":3}
data: {"type":"execution_completed","status":"completed","output":"https://..."}
data: [DONE]
```

## Updating Workflows

Use the `/workflow` endpoint to modify existing workflows:

```json
{
  "message": "Add a subtitle step at the end",
  "workflow_id": "wf_abc123",
  "version_id": "v1"
}
```

## Checking Execution Status

```json
{
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Check the status of execution exec_xyz789"
  }]
}
```

## Parameter References

In workflows created by the agent, use `$` syntax:

| Reference | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `$.inputs.{field}` | Workflow input field |
| `$.step{N}.primary` | Primary output of step N |
| `$.step{N}.outputs.{field}` | Specific output field |
