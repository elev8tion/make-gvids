## When Clarifications Happen

The agent asks for clarification when:

1. **Ambiguous request.** Could be interpreted multiple ways
2. **Missing information.** Required details not provided
3. **Multiple options.** Several valid approaches exist
4. **Safety confirmation.** High-impact operations need a thumbs-up first

## Clarification Event

```json
{
  "type": "clarification_needed",
  "question": "What style would you like for your portrait?",
  "options": [
    "Photorealistic - Natural appearance",
    "Artistic - Painterly look",
    "Anime - Japanese animation style",
    "Cinematic - Movie poster aesthetic"
  ],
  "context": "Each style produces very different results.",
  "requires_response": true
}
```

## Common Scenarios

| Scenario | Example Question |
|----------|-----------------|
| Style selection | "What visual style do you prefer?" |
| Aspect ratio | "What aspect ratio should the image be?" |
| Video duration | "How long should the video be?" |
| Edit type | "What type of edit would you like?" |
| Model selection | "Which model would you prefer?" |

## Responding to Clarifications

Always use the same `session_id` when responding:

### Natural Language (Recommended)

```json
{
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make it anime style with vibrant colors"}],
  "session_id": "my-session"
}
```

### Select an Option

```json
{
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Option 3: Anime"}],
  "session_id": "my-session"
}
```

### Provide All Details Upfront

To avoid clarifications entirely, be specific in your initial request:

```json
{
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Generate an anime-style portrait, 1:1 aspect ratio, cyberpunk background, neon lighting"
  }]
}
```

## Non-Streaming Clarifications

When `stream: false`, check for `clarification_needed: true`:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "clarification_needed": true,
  "question": "What style would you prefer?",
  "options": ["Photorealistic", "Artistic", "Anime"],
  "session_id": "session_abc123"
}
```

## Behavior Mode Impact

- **`agent` mode:** The agent makes smart assumptions when possible, and only asks when things are truly ambiguous
- **`ask` mode:** The agent always checks in with you before executing anything
- **`plan` mode:** The agent shows the game plan and asks for your approval
