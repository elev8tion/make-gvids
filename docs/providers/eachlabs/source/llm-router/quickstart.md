## Prerequisites

- An each::labs API key. [Grab one here](https://www.eachlabs.ai/api-keys) if you don't have one yet.

## Getting Started

  
**Get your API key**
Sign up at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai) and create an API key from [Settings > API Keys](https://eachlabs.ai/settings/api-keys).

  
**Update your code**
Point any OpenAI-compatible SDK to the each::labs base URL:

    
    ```python Python
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
        base_url="https://api.eachlabs.ai/v1"
    )
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import OpenAI from "openai";

    const client = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: "YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
      baseURL: "https://api.eachlabs.ai/v1",
    });
    ```

  
**Make your first request**
Use the `provider/model-name` format to pick any model:

    
    ```python Python
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="openai/gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
        ]
    )

    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
      model: "openai/gpt-4o",
      messages: [
        { role: "user", content: "What is the capital of France?" },
      ],
    });

    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
    ```

## Switch Models Instantly

Just change the `model` parameter. That's literally it. No config changes, no new SDKs, no drama:

```python
# Use Anthropic Claude
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}]
)

# Use Google Gemini
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}]
)

# Use DeepSeek
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek/deepseek-r1",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}]
)
```

## Streaming

Set `stream: true` to receive OpenAI-compatible server-sent events as tokens arrive:

```python Python
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about coding"}],
    stream=True
)

for chunk in stream:
    content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content if chunk.choices else None
    if content:
        print(content, end="")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const stream = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Write a haiku about coding" }],
  stream: true,
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "");
}
```

To include streamed token usage when it is available, pass `stream_options={"include_usage": True}`
in Python or `stream_options: { include_usage: true }` in TypeScript.

## Advanced Features

LLM Router comes with some nice tricks out of the box:

- **Smart Routing** automatically sends requests to the cheapest or fastest provider
- **Fallbacks** so your app doesn't break when a model is having a bad day
- **Caching** to save you money and time on repeated requests
- **Rate Limiting** per model or per user, your call
- **Usage Analytics** to keep tabs on costs, tokens, and latency
