## What is each::workflows?

each::workflows lets you chain multiple AI models together into automated, multi-step pipelines. Define your steps, wire outputs to inputs, and kick off complex AI tasks with a single API call.

```
Text Prompt → Image Generation → Video Animation → Upscaling

              ┬─ Branch 1: Video ──┐
Input Image → ├─ Branch 2: Edit   ─┤→ Conditional → Upscale (video or image)
              └─ Branch 3: Generate┘
```

## Key Features

- **Multi-step pipelines**: Chain any combination of AI models together
- **Parallel branching**: Run multiple branches at the same time for independent tasks
- **Conditional logic**: Route execution based on step outputs using choice steps
- **Parameter references**: Wire step outputs to subsequent step inputs with `{{template}}` syntax
- **Fallback configuration**: Automatic retry with alternative models when things go sideways
- **Versioning**: Create and manage multiple workflow versions with ease
- **Bulk execution**: Fire off up to 10 executions in parallel
- **Webhooks**: Get notified when executions wrap up
- **Public & unlisted sharing**: Share workflows via direct link or public listing

## Base URL

```
https://workflows.eachlabs.run/api/v1
```

> **⚠️  Warning:** This public URL uses a deprecated compatibility host outside the api-service host. It remains supported for now, but will soon move under `https://api.eachlabs.ai`. Keep integrations configurable and switch to the api-service URL once it is published.

## How It Works

  
**Create a workflow**
Define your workflow with steps, input schema, and model configurations.

  
**Trigger execution**
Provide inputs and start an execution. The engine runs steps sequentially, executes parallel branches concurrently, and evaluates conditions to route execution.

  
**Monitor & retrieve results**
Poll the execution endpoint or receive results via webhook.

> **📝  Note:** Need to feed your own images, video, or audio into a workflow? Upload them first via [each::storage](/storage/upload-file) and pass the returned `public_url` in your trigger inputs.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |

| `GET` | `/categories` | List workflow categories |
| `POST` | `/workflows` | Create a workflow |
| `GET` | `/workflows/{id}` | Get workflow details |
| `PUT` | `/workflows/{id}` | Update workflow metadata |
| `PUT` | `/workflows/{id}/versions/{versionID}` | Create/update a version |
| `POST` | `/{id}/trigger` | Trigger execution |
| `POST` | `/{id}/bulk-trigger` | Bulk trigger (up to 10) |
| `GET` | `/workflows/{id}/executions` | List executions |
| `GET` | `/executions/{executionID}` | Get execution details |
| `GET` | `/public/@{nickname}/workflows/{slug}/versions/{versionID}` | Get public workflow |
| `POST` | `/public/@{nickname}/workflows/{slug}/versions/{versionID}/trigger` | Trigger public workflow |

## Pricing

each::workflows is **completely free** to use. No charges for creating, managing, or executing workflows. You only pay for the underlying models that run inside your workflow steps (billed through each::api).
