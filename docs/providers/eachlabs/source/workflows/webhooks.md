## Overview

Provide a `webhook_url` when triggering a workflow to receive an HTTP POST with execution results when it completes (successfully or with an error).

## Setting Up

Include `webhook_url` in your trigger request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://workflows.eachlabs.run/api/v1/WF_ID/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "inputs": {"prompt": "A sunset landscape"},
    "webhook_url": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/workflow-completed"
  }'
```

## Webhook Request

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **Body:** Same structure as [Get Execution](/workflows/endpoints/get-execution) response

## Payload Examples

### Successful Execution

```json
{
  "execution_id": "69ae8c7b-7500-4a45-b7c0-348b8cc2665b",
  "workflow_id": "50741f40-8621-4d46-8a91-dff4d873be98",
  "status": "completed",
  "started_at": "2025-12-04T11:48:10Z",
  "inputs": {
    "prompt": "A sunset landscape"
  },
  "step_outputs": {
    "step1": {
      "step_id": "step1",
      "status": "completed",
      "output": "A breathtaking panoramic view...",
      "primary": "A breathtaking panoramic view...",
      "metadata": {
        "model": "openai-chatgpt-5"
      }
    },
    "step2": {
      "step_id": "step2",
      "status": "completed",
      "output": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/uploads/image.png"],
      "primary": "https://storage.googleapis.com/uploads/image.png",
      "metadata": {
        "model": "flux-1-1-pro"
      }
    }
  },
  "output": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/uploads/image.png"]
}
```

### Failed Execution

```json
{
  "execution_id": "69ae8c7b-7500-4a45-b7c0-348b8cc2665b",
  "workflow_id": "50741f40-8621-4d46-8a91-dff4d873be98",
  "status": "failed",
  "started_at": "2025-12-04T11:48:10Z",
  "inputs": {
    "prompt": "A sunset landscape"
  },
  "error": "ExecutionFailed",
  "error_cause": "Step 'generate_image' failed: Model timeout after 30s"
}
```

### Bulk Trigger Webhook

When triggered via bulk-trigger, the payload includes `bulk_id`:

```json
{
  "execution_id": "exec-1",
  "workflow_id": "50741f40-8621-4d46-8a91-dff4d873be98",
  "bulk_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "completed",
  "output": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/uploads/image.png"]
}
```

Each execution in a bulk operation sends its own webhook notification.

## Handler Examples

```python Python (FastAPI)
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhooks/workflow-completed")
async def handle_workflow_webhook(request: Request):
    execution = await request.json()

    if execution["status"] == "completed":
        final_output = execution["output"]
        step_details = execution["step_outputs"]
        print(f"Workflow completed: {final_output}")
    elif execution["status"] == "failed":
        error = execution.get("error_cause", "Unknown error")
        print(f"Workflow failed: {error}")

    return {"received": True}
```

```javascript JavaScript (Express)
app.post("/webhooks/workflow-completed", (req, res) => {
  const execution = req.body;

  if (execution.status === "completed") {
    console.log(`Workflow completed: ${execution.output}`);
    // Process step_outputs if needed
  } else if (execution.status === "failed") {
    console.error(`Workflow failed: ${execution.error_cause}`);
  }

  res.json({ received: true });
});
```

## Retry Behavior

Failed webhook deliveries are automatically retried with exponential backoff. Your endpoint should return a `200 OK` to acknowledge receipt.

## Best Practices

- Return `200 OK` immediately, process data asynchronously
- Implement idempotency using `execution_id` as a deduplication key
- Handle both `completed` and `failed` statuses
- For bulk operations, correlate webhooks using `bulk_id`
