## Version Lifecycle

Each workflow can have multiple versions. When you trigger a workflow without specifying a version, the latest version runs automatically.

### Version States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `active` | Available for execution |
| `archived` | No longer active |
| `deleted` | Soft-deleted |

### Locking

Once a version is **locked**, it cannot be modified. This is perfect for production versions that need to stay rock-solid.

```json
{
  "version_id": "v1",
  "locked": true,
  "production": true
}
```

## Visibility

Versions have three visibility levels:

| Visibility | `allowed_to_share` | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Private** | `false` (default) | Only your organization |
| **Unlisted** | `true` | Accessible via direct link, hidden from listings |
| **Public** | `-` | Visible in public listings |

### Making a Version Unlisted

```bash
curl -X PUT https://workflows.eachlabs.run/api/v1/workflows/WF_ID/versions/v1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "version_id": "v1",
    "allowed_to_share": true,
    "definition": { ... }
  }'
```

> **📝  Note:** Setting `allowed_to_share: false` on a public version has no effect. Public versions are never downgraded.

## Creating a New Version

Use the [Create Version](/workflows/endpoints/create-version) endpoint:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://workflows.eachlabs.run/api/v1/workflows/WF_ID/versions/v2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "version_id": "v2",
    "definition": {
      "version": "v2",
      "steps": [ ... ],
      "input_schema": { ... }
    }
  }'
```

This sets `v2` as the latest version. Subsequent triggers without a `version_id` will use `v2`.

## Triggering a Specific Version

```json
{
  "version_id": "v1",
  "inputs": { "prompt": "test" }
}
```
