> **🔄  Update:** ## Every model now ships an OpenAPI schema

  - Every model exposes an OpenAPI 3.0 schema at
    `GET /v1/models/{slug}/schemas/openapi`, and its inputs and outputs render
    as a typed reference in the model page's API tab.
  - The machine-readable schema plugs straight into code generators,
    validators, and API explorers, while the same schema drives the
    human-readable reference (types, required flags, defaults, enum values,
    ranges).
  - Coverage is automatic and always in sync: both the endpoint and the API
    tab are derived from each model's request schema, so there's nothing to
    author or maintain per model.

> **🔄  Update:** ## Delete an uploaded file over the API

  - API customers can now delete an uploaded file with `DELETE /v1/files/:id`
    (API-key auth, returns `204`). Files uploaded through the presign flow had
    no delete path before, so once stored there was no way to remove the
    object or its record. This closes that gap for storage cleanup and
    data-deletion or privacy requests.
  - A delete removes the S3 object and soft-deletes the record, so the file
    drops out of list, download, and storage totals immediately.
  - Deletes are org-scoped: callers can only delete files their own org owns.

> **🔄  Update:** ## Your API key can no longer leak from the browser

  The dashboard used to keep a copy of your key in your browser. Now it never
  does. Your key stays on the server and signing in uses a secure session.
  Even a fully compromised browser has no key to steal. Nothing changes for
  you day to day; the biggest place a key could leak is simply gone.

> **🔄  Update:** ## Keys are owned by the organization, so they survive people coming and going

  - Keys belong to the organization, not the person who created them. So when
    a teammate leaves, their keys keep working and your integrations don't
    break.
  - Any API Key Manager or the organization's primary Owner can delete any of
    the org's keys: one place of control, no orphaned keys.
  - Every key records who created it, for audit and accountability.
  - A new **"Can manage API keys"** permission (shown as **"API key access"**
    in the UI) controls who can create and delete keys, and only that. It
    doesn't touch billing, model access, or whether existing keys work.
  - Removing that permission from someone never breaks their existing keys.
    They keep working; the person just can no longer create or delete keys.
  - A Manager manages all of the org's keys; there's no per-key granularity
    today.

> **🔄  Update:** ## You hold your key, we don't, so copy it when you create it

  For security, the full key value is shown only once, at the moment you
  create it, and is never stored anywhere it can be shown again. Copy it then
  and keep it safe. If it's ever lost, just create a new key and delete the
  old one.

> **🔄  Update:** ## You can finally tell dashboard runs apart from API runs

  - Executions, usage, and per-model request history now filter by source
    (**Dashboard** vs **API**), by specific **key**, and by **teammate**, so
    you can attribute every run and every dollar of spend to the right key or
    person. You can even recover history from keys that were later deleted.
    This came straight from customer feedback.
  - The selected view is deep-linkable, so you can share a URL that lands on
    exactly the breakdown you're looking at.
  - Reported usage is more accurate: internal dashboard traffic no longer
    inflates your API usage totals.

> **🔄  Update:** ## Keys are recognizable at a glance: they start with `smk_`

  The keys you create for the API now begin with `smk_`, so they're easy to
  spot in your code, your logs, and support tickets.

> **🔄  Update:** ## New accounts start clean, no confusing unused key

  Signing up no longer auto-creates a key you could neither see nor use.
  Running and uploading inside the dashboard work immediately with zero
  setup; you create a key only when you actually need external API access.

> **🔄  Update:** ## Faster model browsing

  Model, provider, and family pages are rebuilt on a new data layer, with
  noticeably faster loads and the newest models shown first.

> **🔄  Update:** ## A home for all your files

  The storage page brings every file you've uploaded or generated into one
  place. Browse inputs and outputs together, and filter by date range,
  execution, or file type to find exactly what you need.

> **🔄  Update:** ## Clearer failure messages

  When an execution fails, you now get more specific error detail, including
  provider-side reasons from image and video models, so you can tell what
  went wrong without digging through logs.
