## What Are Webhooks?

Instead of polling for prediction results, you can provide a `webhook_url` when creating a prediction. each::labs will POST the result to your URL when the prediction completes.

> **📝  Note:** Currently, webhooks are only supported for Workflows V2. Support for other services is being expanded.

## How It Works

  
**Provide a webhook URL**
Include `webhook_url` (and optionally `webhook_secret`) when creating a prediction.

  
**Prediction runs**
The model processes your input asynchronously.

  
**Result delivered**
When complete, each::labs POSTs the result to your webhook URL.

## Setting Up Webhooks

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.eachlabs.ai/v1/prediction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "flux-1-1-pro",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "input": {"prompt": "A mountain landscape"},
    "webhook_url": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/prediction",
    "webhook_secret": "whsec_your_secret_key"
  }'
```

## Retry Behavior

Failed webhook deliveries are automatically retried with exponential backoff. You can track delivery attempts using the [Get Webhook](/api/webhooks/get-webhook) endpoint.

### Delivery Attempt Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PENDING` | Delivery is queued |
| `SUCCESS` | Delivered successfully (2xx response) |
| `FAILED` | Delivery failed (timeout, non-2xx, or connection error) |

## Webhook Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/webhooks` | [List all webhooks](/api/webhooks/list-webhooks) |
| `GET` | `/v1/webhooks/{execution_id}` | [Get webhook details with delivery attempts](/api/webhooks/get-webhook) |
