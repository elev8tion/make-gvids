## What is each::storage?

each::storage is managed file hosting for the media that flows through each::labs. Upload an image, video, or audio file once and get back a stable public URL you can pass straight into [each::api](/api/overview) predictions and [each::workflows](/workflows/overview) — no need to stand up your own bucket or CDN.

It's also the layer each::labs uses to deliver results: model and workflow outputs are typically (though not always) served as `cdn-us.eachlabs.ai` URLs, so the files you upload and the results you get back share one fast, consistent host.

## Why use it

- **No infrastructure to run** — skip hosting and signing your own uploads; we hand you a presigned URL and a stable public link.
- **Built for model inputs** — returned URLs are reliably fetchable by our executors, so predictions don't fail on inaccessible media.
- **One platform, one key** — uploads use the same `X-API-Key` as the rest of each::api.
- **Fast delivery** — files are served from a CDN over HTTPS.

## How it works

  
**Request a presigned URL**
Call [Upload File](/storage/upload-file) (`POST /v1/upload/presign`) with the file's content type. You get a short-lived upload URL plus a public `public_url`.

  
**Upload the bytes**
`PUT` the raw file to the presigned URL. A `200 OK` means it's live.

  
**Use the URL**
Pass `public_url` as an input to any model or workflow. Call [Delete File](/storage/delete-file) when you no longer need it.

## Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Max file size | 100 MB per upload |
| Presigned URL lifetime | 15 minutes |
| Supported file types | `image`, `video`, `audio`, `other` |

## Where your data resides

Files are stored in the **United States** and delivered through the `cdn-us.eachlabs.ai` CDN over HTTPS.

## Access & privacy

Each `public_url` contains an unguessable identifier but is readable by anyone who has the link — treat it as public. File management is scoped to your organization through your API key: you can only delete files uploaded under your own account.
