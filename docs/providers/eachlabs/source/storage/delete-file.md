title: "Delete File"
description: "Permanently delete a file you previously uploaded."
---

## Overview

Permanently deletes a file you uploaded with [Upload File](/storage/upload-file). Pass the `id` returned by the presign step. A successful delete removes the stored object, so the file's `public_url` stops resolving.

Deletes are **idempotent** — deleting a file that's already gone returns the same `204 No Content`.

## Endpoint

```
DELETE https://api.eachlabs.ai/v1/files/{id}
```

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string (UUID) | Yes | The file id returned by [Upload File](/storage/upload-file) — the `id` field of the presign response. |

### Code Examples

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE https://api.eachlabs.ai/v1/files/0dce0f44-b8a5-4f30-91d4-5f6b0c221bf0 \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

resp = requests.delete(
    "https://api.eachlabs.ai/v1/files/0dce0f44-b8a5-4f30-91d4-5f6b0c221bf0",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"},
)
print(resp.status_code)  # 204 on success
```

```javascript JavaScript
const resp = await fetch(
  "https://api.eachlabs.ai/v1/files/0dce0f44-b8a5-4f30-91d4-5f6b0c221bf0",
  {
    method: "DELETE",
    headers: { "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY" },
  },
);
// resp.status === 204
```

### Response

A successful delete returns `204 No Content` with an empty body.

## Error Responses

| Status | Body | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `400` | `{"error": "invalid argument"}` | `id` is not a valid UUID. |
| `401` | `{}` | Missing or invalid API key. |
| `404` | `{"error": "file not found"}` | No such file in your organization. |
| `409` | `{"error": "conflict"}` | The file is still being processed and isn't in a deletable state yet. Retry once the upload has finished. |

> **📝  Note:** Deletes are permanent and idempotent. A successful delete removes the stored object, so any `public_url` for the file stops resolving. Deleting a file that was already deleted — or never existed in your account — also returns `204`.
